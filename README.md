## üìù Overview

In this repository, you'll explore some of the most essential NLP techniques used in real-world applications. You‚Äôll not only learn **what** each technique does, but also how to apply it effectively using **Python**. Each section contains both theoretical explanations and practical implementations that you can easily follow and run.

### Topics Covered:

1. **Tokenization**:  
   Break down text into smaller chunks (tokens), such as words or sentences. Essential for processing and analyzing text.

2. **Stopwords Removal**:  
   Learn to filter out commonly occurring but unimportant words like "the", "is", etc., to focus on meaningful content.

3. **Stemming**:  
   Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" ‚Üí "run") to standardize variations of words.

4. **Lemmatization**:  
   More advanced than stemming, lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "better" ‚Üí "good").

5. **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**:  
   Identify the grammatical components (nouns, verbs, adjectives) of a sentence, which is crucial for tasks like sentiment analysis.

6. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**:  
   Detect and classify named entities in text, such as people, organizations, and locations.

7. **Text to Vectors**:  
   Convert textual data into numerical vectors for machine learning models.  
   - **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represent text based on word frequency.
   - **N-Grams**: Capture word pairs or sequences to understand context.
   - **TF-IDF**: Evaluate the importance of words within a document relative to a collection.
   - **Word2Vec**: A powerful method to create dense vector representations of words.
